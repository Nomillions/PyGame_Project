Noah Miller's creation and submission for PyGame Midterm Project

#####################################################################################################
GAME OVERVIEW:

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship right andleft using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game beings, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If an alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom
of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: 

Complete Project I: Alien Invasion using PyGame from the textbook - Python Crash Course. 
It is covered completely in chapters 12 through 14.

Read and follow all the steps to create the game in its entirety. DO NOT TAKE SHORT-CUTS!

As with other projects, you will use GitHub to maintain a repository of your code. 
Your GitHub repository should have a history of changes to your files as you will be 
enhancing your code as you move along through the project. Every time the textbook 
makes a change to the code, make sure to commit your changes (with an appropriate message) 
and push it to GitHub.

You have to be very familiar with what you are doing to create the fully functional game. 
After submitting your your project, you will need to schedule a time for me to interview 
you regarding the project. I may ask specific questions on code and also have you describe 
how you created certain objects and how you  would enhance the game.

All the material is described and laid out for you in the project in the textbook. 
All you have to do is read, follow along, write your code and debug it for errors.

It would be best not to just copy and paste the code as you may not recognize bugs 
and you will not be able to answer my questions which will greatly impact your grade.
